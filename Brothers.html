We have a unique opportunity to build something at Northeastern that we want to come back to and continue participating in every year after we graduate. Fiji is a chance to be part of an organization that both prepares every brother to take leadership roles and provides lifelong networking opportunities through graduate chapters around the country. We're here to extend those opportunities to the future brothers of Phi Gamma Delta at Northeastern.</p>

                                <p><u>Why Fiji?</u> I chose to join Fiji in order to challenge myself to try something outside my comfort zone and truly build an organization from scratch.

                                <p><u>Why Fiji?</u> I went on a road trip during the May after my Freshman year with a childhood friend who is a founding father at NAU. After road tripping with him and another friend and hearing their experiences and ideals they gained by pledging to Fiji, I thought I’d try to recreate the success they have had here at NEU. Now, I already believe that we are well on our way to becoming a success.
