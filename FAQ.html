                                <p> <strong>Q: How many bids do you give out? </strong><br />                                 A: If you’re a good fit for us, you won’t be turned away. “If a fiji walks through the door...”. We don’t have a set number/quota to meet. <br />
                                </p>
                                <br />
                                <p>  <strong>Q: What is the difference between a colony and a chapter? </strong> <br /> A: A colony is a probationary period where our group is looking to gain full recognition from the IHQ. Operationally, it is no different than a full fledged chapter. 
                                    We need to prove to the International Fraternity that we have what it takes to maintain Fiji’s legacy here at Northeastern. Our primary focus over the coming years will be meeting all of the requirements for receiving our charter. 
                                    Every pledge class until we charter will be a founding father class. 

                                </p>
                                <br />
                                <p> <strong> Q: What are you looking for in a prospective new member (PNM)?</strong>
                                    <br /> A: We are looking for gentlemen of quality who have the ability to move our brotherhood and organization forward.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p> <strong> Q: Where do you rank yourselves among the other fraternities?</strong>
                                    <br />
                                    A: Everyone thinks their fraternity is the best. Would you believe us if we told you we rank ourselves first? (Have to kind of laugh this question off). We just try to be our best and we don’t really concern ourselves with rank. 
                                </p>
                                <br />
                                <p> <strong> Q: Do you guys haze?</strong>
                                <br /> A: No. We do not see hazing as a productive method of building brotherhood. We will have an anonymous system for reporting hazing.  </p>
                                <br />
                                <p> <strong> Q: Do you have a house?</strong> <br />
                                    A: Fraternity houses are illegal in the city of Boston but we have multiple apartments off campus with brothers living there so there is always a place to hangout.
                                </p>
                                <br />
                                <p> <strong> Q: Why Fiji? What’s different?</strong>
                                <br /> Currently, we are building this fraternity from scratch/from the ground up. No other fraternity on campus is currently doing that. If having a profound impact on the future of this organization interests you, definitely Rush Fiji. </p>

                                <p> <strong>Q: What organizations do you support? </strong><br />                                 A: We support the American Red Cross, USO, and Donate Life organizations. Red Cross = disaster relief, USO = helps service members and their families, Donate Life = encourages people to sign up for organ donation. Because we are so new, we have many opportunities to partner with new organizations in the future. 
                                </p>
                                <br />
                                <p> <strong> Q: What volunteer opportunities exist?</strong> A: Community Servings (delivering meals to the elderly), Breakfast Club (clean up Mission Hill or Fenway early on a weekend morning), Greater Boston Food Bank, Walk to Defeat ALS, opportunities with sororities (Cradles to Crayons with Kappa Delta, Day of Service with Chi Omega)  </p>
                                <br />
                                <p> <strong> Q: What are dues? </strong><br />
                                    A: The dues will be around $450 per semester. This goes towards things like chartering, brotherhood/social events, and recruitment.  There is a small one time pledging fee of $100 to cover pledging materials. However, there is the AAA scholarship for $250 if you achieve a 3.2 GPA during your pledging semester. 
                                </p>
                                <br />
                                <p> <strong> Q: What is pledging like?</strong>
                                <br /> A: Pledging is a process that allows you to get to know the brothers on a deeper level, learn the values of the Fraternity, and learn how we operate. We use this time to prepare you to become an initiated brother.
                                </p>
                                <br />
                                <p> <strong> Q: Do you guys party?</strong>
                                <br /> A: Partying exists, but it is not the priority. We expect individuals to be balanced and well-rounded, and do more with/for the fraternity than party. </p>
                                <br />
                                <p> <strong> Q: Do you guys party?</strong>
                                <br /> A: Our social chairman plans events, but it is not the priority. We expect individuals to be balanced and well-rounded, and do more with/for the fraternity than party. </p>
                                <br />
                                <p> <strong> Q: What’s up with FIJI vs Phi Gamma Delta?</strong> <br /> A: Fiji is our nickname, it is the combination of phi (fi), and gamma, or the letter “G”. We use this nickname because we believe our letters are sacred and can only be used in certain places. </p>
